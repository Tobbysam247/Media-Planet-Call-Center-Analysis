This project presents an in-depth analysis of customer service operations at the **Media Planet Call Centre** for **Q1 2021**. The insights help reveal patterns in customer interactions, identify areas of opportunity, and offer actionable recommendations to boost service efficiency and satisfaction.

---

## Overview

 **Period Covered**: January ‚Äì March 2021  
 **Team Size**: 8 Agents  
 **Total Calls**: ~5,000  
 **Resolution Rate**: 72%  
 **Focus Areas**: Streaming, Tech, Payments, Admin, Contracts  

---

## Key Insights

### 1. **Peak Moments, Stretched Teams**
- January accounted for nearly 1,800 calls which were over one-third of the entire quarter.
- Each agent managed approximately 625 calls during Q1.
- **Recommendation**: Deploy "surge squads" or temporary flex shifts in peak months like January to avoid agent burnout and maintain service quality.

---

### 2. **Longer Calls Signal Deeper Issues**
- Over 50% of calls lasted 4‚Äì7 minutes, suggesting technical and streaming support is not just surface-level.
- **Recommendation**: Introduce quick-reference guides or cheat sheets to help agents confidently handle repeat or complex issues, reducing resolution time and stress.

---

### 3. **Evenly Distributed Query Types**
- Breakdown of topics:  
  - Streaming: 1,022  
  - Tech: 1,019  
  - Payments: 1,007  
  - Admin: 976  
  - Contracts: 976  
-  **Recommendation**: Offer specialized micro-trainings or workshops for each major category to transform agents into subject-matter specialists.

---

### 4. **Resolution Gap**
- 72% resolution rate means that 28% of callers leave without answers.
-  **Recommendation**: Investigate failed resolutions, and follow up when possible. Even 5-minute callbacks can turn frustration into long-term customer loyalty.

---

### 5. **Voices of Satisfaction (and Silence)**
- Feedback split:  
  - Satisfied: 40%  
  - Neutral: 24%  
  - Unhappy: 16%  
  - No feedback: 20%  
- **Recommendation**: Launch a simplified one-click survey or follow-up thank-you message. Make it easy to capture feedback from silent users and improve service quality across the board.

---

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, sorting, and categorization  
- **Power BI**: Power Query, DAX formulas, Dashboard design, KPI visualization, and analysis storytelling

---

## Business Recommendations

To boost operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction in Q2 and beyond, Media Planet should:

- **Scale the team strategically**: Anticipate high-traffic periods and allocate resources accordingly.
- **Empower agents**: Provide them with quick tools and deeper training to handle complex calls more confidently.
- **Invest in follow-ups**: Resolution doesn't always end with the first call. Re-engaging unsatisfied callers can turn complaints into compliments.
- **Enhance feedback collection**: Streamline the survey process to increase response rates and identify blind spots.
- **Introduce self-service options**: For routine issues (payments, contracts), consider FAQs or chatbot solutions to reduce live agent load.

---

## Outcome Focus

Implementing these recommendations could lead to:
- Shorter wait and handle times  
- Higher resolution and satisfaction rates  
- More efficient staffing cycles  
- Improved customer loyalty and brand trust
